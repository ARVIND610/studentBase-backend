issues
how to specify slots [date/time]
    do we need to make custom design or can we integrate calendly
accept/reject/reschedule slot
university specific login
can students of different university create application togather
application stage
    after student requests visit, does landlord need to accepts it
    what will happen after visit
    what will happen after ll approves application
