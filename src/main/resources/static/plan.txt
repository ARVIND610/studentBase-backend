issues
how to specify slots [date/time]
    do we need to make custom design or can we integrate calendly
accept/reject/reschedule slot
university specific login
can students of different university create application togather
application stage
    after student requests visit, does landlord need to accepts it
    what will happen after visit
    what will happen after ll approves application
    how student will add others to same application
    what happens after ll rejects visit request


Landlord form add changes
- [Y] Add landlord name
- [ ] Explain images get the doc
- [ ] Explain the features implementation
- [ ] Listing should not go to admin for verification till landlord add all the things like images for property and all the important details

Student flow changes
- [ ] Add field for student image
- [ ] Create api to submit docs to admin it should not go automatically.â€¨Need to add one more step to state for both landlords and students


Admin side issues:
- [ ] Api not working properly for fetching of users in admin
- [ ] When fetching students in admin images are not working need another api for fetching particular student
- [ ] While rejecting landlord listing reason not coming
- [ ] Why to send reason to accept listing or student
- [ ]

Miscellaneous

- [ ] Getting 403 error on not sending proper request should get 400
- [ ] Getting 403 in sending get instead of put not sending required param
